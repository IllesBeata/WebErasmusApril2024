            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <div class="ingredients">
                <ul>
                    <li>2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell)</li>
                    <li>1½ Tbsp whole milk</li>
                    <li>¼ tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
                     <li>¼ cup cake flour</li>
                    <li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp sugar</li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp neutral oil</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp water</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <div class="instructions">
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk the egg yolks, milk, and vanilla in a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well and set aside.</li>
                    <li>With your electric hand mixer or stand mixer with whisk attachment, beat egg whites until frothy. Add sugar and continue to beat egg whites to stiff peaks.</li>
                    <li>Set your skillet on low heat and add a small pat of butter, letting it melt while you prepare the batter.</li>
                    <li>While skillet is warming up, mix your batter by combining about 1/3 of the stiff egg whites to your egg yolk mixture. Use a rubber spatula to fold it in. When batter is homogenous, add the rest of the egg whites and gently fold to combine, taking care not to overmix.</li>
                    <li>By this time, your skillet should be warm enough to begin cooking your pancakes. Use your cookie scoop to place 4-5 scoops spaced out in your skillet (alternatively you could use a piping bag or spoon). Add a second round of scoops on top of your original 4 or 5. Carefully pour 1 tbsp of water into your skillet, avoiding the pancake batter. Quickly cover your skillet with a lid and set a timer for two minutes.</li>
                    <li>After two minutes, remove lid and add an additional scoop of batter onto each pancake. Replace lid and continue cooking on low-medium heat for another 5-6 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Uncover your skillet. By this time, the bottom of your pancakes should be a golden brown. If they are not, increase your heat and cook for another minute, watching your pancakes carefully so they don't burn. When they are golden brown on the bottom, carefully flip over your pancakes. Sprinkle another tbsp of water into the skillet and cover.</li>
                    <li>Cook for another 4 minutes or until the bottom of the pancake is golden brown and the sides have cooked and are dry to the touch. Repeat the cooking process for the remaining batter (may take 1-2 more batches).</li>
                    <li>Serve pancakes immediately with toppings to your liking. Leftovers can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature.</li>

            <div class="ingredients">
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
                     <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
                    <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <div class="instructions">
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>
                    <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>1/4 cup caster / superfine sugar</li>
                    <li>2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>1 cup flour, plain / all purpose</li>
                    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                    <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp vegetable, canola or olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
                    <li>2 cups+ vegetable or canola oil</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate or semi sweet chocolate chips</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup thickened / heavy cream </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <ol>
                    <li>Cinnamon sugar coating: Combine sugar and cinnamon in a shallow bowl, set aside.</li>
                    <li>Batter: Mix flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Add oil and water and mix until just combined - it should be a thick, gummy batter, like a wet sticky dough, not thin and watery.</li>
                    <li>Piping bag: Transfer dough into a piping bag with a 8mm / 1/3" star tip nozzle. Set aside while oil heats.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil: Heat 5cm / 2" oil over medium high in a small pot, wok or small but deep skillet (Note 3) to 170°C/340°F, or until it takes 20 seconds for a small cube of bread to turn golden.</li>
                    <li>Pipe & snip: Pipe 15cm / 6" lengths of dough into the oil, snipping with scissors (snip close to oil surface to avoid splash). Do 3 to 4 per batch, makes 10 to 12 in total.</li>
                    <li>Cook: Cook for 2-3 minutes or until golden and crisp, rolling occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Drain: Remove onto paper towel lined plate to drain. Then roll in sugar. Serve hot with Chocolate Sauce!</li>
                    <li>Place in a heatproof bowl and microwave in 30 second bursts, stirring in between, until smooth. Set aside for 5 minutes to cool and thicken slightly.</li>

            <div class="ingredients">
                <ul>
                    <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
                    <li>½ cup/100 grams granulated sugar, divided</li>
                    <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
                    <li>1 cup/227 grams mascarpone (8 ounces)</li>
                    <li>1 ¾ cups good espresso or very strong coffee</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons rum or cognac</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                    <li>About 24 ladyfingers (from one 7-ounce/200-gram package)</li>
                    <li>1 to 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, for shaving (optional)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <div class="instructions">
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the cream: Using an electric mixer in a large bowl, whip together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until it creates soft peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.</li>
                    <li>For the assembly, combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an 8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch round cake pan would also work here) with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.</li>
                    <li>Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture -- they are quite porous and will fall apart if left in the liquid too long -- and place them rounded side up at the bottom of the baking dish. Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you’ve got an even layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any obvious gaps (a little space in between is O.K.). Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer. Repeat with remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.</li>
                    <li>Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder. Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (if you can wait 24 hours, all the better). Top with shaved or finely grated chocolate, if desired, then slice or scoop to serve.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>1 ¾ cups powdered sugar(210 g)</li>
                    <li>1 cup almond flour(95 g), finely ground</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
                    <li>3 egg whites, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>¼ cup granulated sugar(50 g)</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>2 drops pink gel food coloring</li>
                    <li>1 cup unsalted butter(230 g), 2 sticks, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>3 cups powdered sugar(360 g)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons heavy cream</li>

            <div class="instructions">
                <ol>
                    <li>Make the macarons: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the powdered sugar, almond flour, and ½ teaspoon of salt, and process on low speed, until extra fine. Sift the almond flour mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl.</li>
                    <li>In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites and the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt with an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add the granulated sugar until fully incorporated. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form (you should be able to turn the bowl upside down without anything falling out).</li>
                    <li>Add the vanilla and beat until incorporated. Add the food coloring and beat until just combined.</li>
                    <li>Add about ⅓ of the sifted almond flour mixture at a time to the beaten egg whites and use a spatula to gently fold until combined. After the last addition of almond flour, continue to fold slowly until the batter falls into ribbons and you can make a figure 8 while holding the spatula up.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the macaron batter into a piping bag fitted with a round tip.</li>
                    <li>Place 4 dots of the batter in each corner of a rimmed baking sheet, and place a piece of parchment paper over it, using the batter to help adhere the parchment to the baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Pipe the macarons onto the parchment paper in 1½-inch (3-cm) circles, spacing at least 1-inch (2-cm) apart.</li>
                    <li>Tap the baking sheet on a flat surface 5 times to release any air bubbles.</li>
                    <li>Let the macarons sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until dry to the touch.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 300˚F (150˚C).</li>
                    <li>Bake the macarons for 17 minutes, until the feet are well-risen and the macarons don’t stick to the parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the macarons to a wire rack to cool completely before filling.</li>
                    <li>Make the buttercream: In a large bowl, add the butter and beat with a mixer for 1 minute until light and fluffy. Sift in the powdered sugar and beat until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla and beat to combine. Add the cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat to combine, until desired consistency is reached.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a round tip.</li>
                    <li>Add a dollop of buttercream to one macaron shell. Top it with another macaron shell to create a sandwich. Repeat with remaining macaron shells and buttercream.</li>
                    <li>Place in an airtight container for 24 hours to “bloom”.</li>
